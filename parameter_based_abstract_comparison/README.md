# Abstract Comparison Tool

This Streamlit-based web app allows users to compare two research abstracts by extracting and analyzing key elements such as technologies used, architecture style, development tools, and more. The tool uses NLP techniques and cosine similarity to quantify how similar two abstracts are, based on user-selected parameters.



## Features

- Supports both file upload (PDF, DOCX) and text input
- Parameter-based comparison (e.g., Technology, Architecture Style, etc.)
- Uses [Sentence Transformers](https://www.sbert.net/) and cosine similarity for comparing abstracts
- Keyword extraction powered by Spacy & WordNet
- Outputs similarity score and extracted elements per abstract
